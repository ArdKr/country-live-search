This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Check out the [demo](https://country-live-search.netlify.app/)

# Clone the repository using git
git clone https://github.com/ArdKr/country-live-search.git

cd country-live-search

# Install required packages

# If you want to only check it you can use live server
npm start
```

## Technologies used

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). was used to create the starting structure
- Components were build using [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used to style the components

Got the idea from [this site](https://www.golangprograms.com/react-js-projects-for-beginners/search-autocomplete-in-react-js.html). And also the country list from there.
